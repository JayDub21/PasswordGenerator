------
Using vanilla Javascript, this simple password generator gives the user options for:

* Character length of 8-128 characters.
* Special characters: (!@#$%^&*)
* Numbers: (1234567890)
* Lower cased letters: (abcde)
* Upper cased letters: (ABCDE)

After the user has selected their desired attributes, the script creates a custom string to draw random characters from.

The page layout is unchanged for mobile and larger screen sizes, using the CSS Grid.
